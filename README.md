## This is an amazing period in human history.  It was just yesteryear that when the era of personal computers were born, from the Commodore VIC-20 and Apple II to the IBM PC.  Along came the internet and in the blink of an eye, 40 years later, LLM Large Language Models are here.  

## I believe Large Language Models (software) is the third revolution after personal computers (hardware) and internet (connectivity).

## Throughout human history, technology and knowledge have contributed to improving the quality of life.  Large Language Models are no exception. 


## So, it is time to let the Genie out of the bottle and see the power of combine that benefit us all... while having fun!
